### Description

This is a full web browser, with back, forward, refresh, etc. Also has a HTML editor. Its very easy to use & to change (code wise).

I have also included all of the forms as well as the application.

If you like it, plase mail me! Enjoy.
 
### More Info
 
Some combinations of the windows may cause the application to crash.
