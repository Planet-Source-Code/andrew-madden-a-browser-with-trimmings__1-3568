          Andrew's Web Browser
========================================

This application can be used by anybody,
any code can be cut out, please, use it as
you see fit. I hope you enjoy it. 
_____________________________________________

There are a few problems however:
Firstly, you can not have the frmbrowser 
window open when you preview using the html 
editor. 

Secondly, I think it will only work in Visual 
Basic V 6.x

Finally, the HTML editor will not "fill".
_____________________________________________

If you can amend any of the above, thanks will 
be given!

Feel free to distribute it (just keep the
sprout!). 

I know it is made from a patch-work
of other peoples code as well as my own,
but since I can't remember all of the code
soures, thanks to all of you. I just hope
some one may learn something from this!

Ah, yes, the password is "password". Original
uh? You can change this though.

Leave the field "user name" blank (unless it 
is automaticly filled in).

Enjoy!
